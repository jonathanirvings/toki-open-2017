# toki-open-2017

The repository consists of the skeleton, solution, problem descriptions, and testcase generator for TOKI Open 2017.

The testcases are generated using [tcframe](https://github.com/tcframe/tcframe) framework. We also use [tcrand](https://github.com/afaji/tcrand) library for some problems.

Enjoy.
